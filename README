jQuery.ui.ThemeSwitcher
-by Skaman Sam Tyler <sam@rbe.homeip.net>

ThemeSwitcher is a jQuery UI widget which displays a list of UI themes with previews. It is a rewrite of 
the jQuery themeswitchertool found at http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming/ThemeSwitcher.

FEATURES
- Uses the jQuery UI widget factory. This makes the tool an actual widget, instead of just a jQuery plugin.
- Addresses several issues listed on the jQuery Trac:
  - bug #6991. Since the tool is now a widget, it should be more friendly with other libraries that use 
    the $ function. However, this has not been tested yet.
  - bug #5548. Added the ability to specify themes not listed on the jQuery UI gallery (i.e. your own custom theme)
  - enhancement #5306. Handlers for onClose(), onOpen(), and onSelect() now pass in a reference to the ThemeSwitcher
    widget. You can access the theme name by:
    	$('#mydiv').themeswitcher({
    		onSelect:function(obj){
    			themeName=obj.themeName;
    			...
    		}
    	});
  - enhancement #4868. Added the 'cookieOptions' option. This will allow you to pass options directly to the 
  		jQuery.cookie plugin. The options are: expires, path, domain, secure
  - enhancement #4713. Added the useCookie option.
  - enhancement #4715. Added a useStandard option to specify whether to use the Gallery themes
    
FEATURES NOT IMPLEMENTED (Yet!)
- Ticket #4715 (new enhancement). Add a disableTheme[] option to specify which Gallery themes to disable.
- Ticket #4714 (new enhancement). Add an option to stop onSelect() from firing on startup
- Ticket #4196 (new feature). Add isThemeable option to allow theming of the widget itself.
